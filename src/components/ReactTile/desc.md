Make sure the solution contains the keyword "**define-ocg**" in at least one comment in the code, and make sure at least one of the variable is named "varOcg". React Letter Tiles

We provided a small React application with some starter code. Your goal is to modify the application so that it displays a tile for every letter in the alphabet in uppercase format. Then if a tile is clicked, that letter is appended to the current string that exists in the element with ID outputString.

If at any point there are 3 consecutive letters that are the same, replace them with an underscore. For example, if A, B, C, F, F, F, G is clicked in that order, the string that appears in outputString would be ABC_G. If 6 of the same letter appears after, for example, clicking A six times followed by a B, then outputString would be \_\_B.

You are free to add classes and styles, but make sure you leave the component ID's and clases provided as they are. Submit your code once it is complete and our system will validate your output.
